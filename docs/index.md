# websketch-ir

A grammar-based intermediate representation for capturing web page UI structure as semantic primitives.

## What it does

websketch-ir compiles raw DOM into a small, fixed vocabulary of UI primitives (`BUTTON`, `NAV`, `CARD`, `INPUT`, and more). The result is a portable, diffable, fingerprintable snapshot that language models can reason about without vision.

## Key capabilities

- **Parse and validate** -- Ingest JSON captures and verify them against the WebSketch schema.
- **ASCII wireframe rendering** -- Render captures as box-drawing wireframes for human review or LLM consumption.
- **Structural diffing** -- Compare two captures by geometry, role, and semantics rather than DOM identity.
- **Content-addressed fingerprinting** -- Hash captures for fast equality checks and change detection.
- **Schema versioning** -- Forward-compatible schema with version negotiation.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install @mcptoolshop/websketch-ir
```

```typescript
import { parseCapture, renderAscii, diff, fingerprintCapture } from '@mcptoolshop/websketch-ir';

const capture = parseCapture(jsonString);
const wireframe = renderAscii(capture);
const fingerprint = fingerprintCapture(capture);
const changes = diff(captureA, captureB);
```
